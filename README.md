# Gauge fiddle
Based on my FastAPI app template - this repo is just to try out Gauge and BDD approach in general

Contains:
- FastAPI, PostgreSQL/MySQL, Redis, Nginx services
- Deployment script + Github Workflow
- A structured API directory with functioning OAuth for a ready-to-go User model
- Redis-based queueing, rate-limiting and more
- AND Gauge tests!
