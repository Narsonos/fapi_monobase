# FastAPI application template (monolith)
This repo contains a template of a FastAPI monolith application that can be extended as a project it is used for needs. 

For monitoring/observability module:

ðŸ‘‰ [See this repo](https://github.com/Narsonos/warden)

## This repo contains:
- FastAPI, MySQL, Redis, Nginx - core of the project.
- Celery and beat (though not used) - there's a config and CeleryTaskProcessor wrapper for convenience and loose coupling.
- User and Auth services, 4-layer architecture, caching.
- Github Actions workflows for automated deployment with a python script for simple Blue-Green deployment.
- Tests - unit, e2e, integration. ~98% coverage. There's a couple of very simple k6 tests.
- MySQL pre-baked image builder - makes tests run quicker!


## Table of expected ENV Variables (see github workflow files)
If the template is deployed without Github Actions workflow, but rather directly with the compose files - it is important to provide ENV values using according files:
 - .env (as prod)
 - .env.dev (for dev compose)
 - .env.test (for test compose). Database username/passwords get baked into the used MYSQL image when you run mysql_builder - please, be aware of that.

Otherwise, if Github Actions workflow is used - all envs are set there, refer to the table below.
Additional configuration can be provided in ./services/api/app/common/config.py
